## 5. Backlog Readiness

### MVP Scope (P0 - Must Have)
1. ✅ **Drag-drop multi-file upload** (10+ file types)
2. ✅ **P2P link generation** (copy to clipboard)
3. ✅ **Gateway fallback** (>99% retrieval success)
4. ✅ **File validation** (MIME, size, magic bytes)
5. ✅ **Filebase pinning** (primary IPFS provider)

### P1 Features (Defer If Needed)
- URL scraping (YouTube, OpenGraph)
- File preview (inline PDF, image, video)
- QR code sharing
- Storacha secondary pinning

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

- Feature: Filebase IPFS upload API integration
- **Target**: 40-50 story points (conservative first sprint)

**Sprint 2** (Week 3-4):
- Feature: P2P link generation (CID → shareable URL)
- Feature: Gateway fallback mechanism
- Feature: File list UI (browse uploaded files)
- Feature: Collection page (view shared files)
- **Target**: 50-60 story points (baseline velocity)

**Capacity**:
- Solo developer: ~15 hours/week × 2 weeks = 30 hours/sprint
- Estimated velocity: 40-60 story points/sprint

**Backlog Health**: ✅ **HEALTHY** (2 sprints planned, P0 features scoped)

## 6. Decision and Next Steps

### Decision: PROCEED TO CONSTRUCTION ✅

**Rationale**:
- Architecture baseline complete and validated through technical spike
- Critical risk (R-001: IPFS reliability) retired via Filebase integration
- MVP scope clearly defined with P0 features

- Solo developer constraints acknowledged and managed

### Immediate Next Steps (Iteration 0 - 1-2 Days)

**Critical**:
1. Create GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
2. Deploy to Vercel (connect GitHub repo)
3. Configure Vercel environment variables (`FILEBASE_IPFS_RPC_KEY`)
4. Enable Vercel Analytics
5. Create `.vscode/settings.json` workspace configuration
6. Generate Master Test Plan

**Timeline**: 6-12 hours work (1-2 days calendar time)

### Sprint 1 Start (Week 1)

**Kick-off**: Immediately after Iteration 0 validation

**Focus**: Setup + first P0 features (drag-drop upload, file validation)

**Ceremonies**:
- Daily standup: Self-check (solo developer)
- Mid-sprint review: Progress check
