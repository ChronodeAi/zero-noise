## Architecture Baseline Summary

### Architecture Proven

**✅ Component Architecture**:
- Frontend (React/Next.js 14): UploadZone, FileList, ShareButton components designed
- Edge Functions (Vercel): /api/upload, /api/retrieve, /api/scrape specified
- IPFS Storage: Filebase S3-compatible + Web3.Storage redundancy
- Gateway Layer: Multi-gateway racing (ipfs.io, dweb.link, cloudflare) + CDN fallback

**✅ API Contracts Defined**:
- POST /api/upload: Multipart form-data → Collection CID + file CIDs
- GET /api/retrieve: CID → Binary data via fastest gateway
- POST /api/scrape: URL → Metadata (title, description, thumbnail)

**✅ Data Models Specified**:
- IPFS File Object: CID, name, size, type, links
- IPFS Directory Object: Collection CID with file links
- TypeScript interfaces for FileMetadata, AppState, component props

**✅ Security Controls**:
- File validation pipeline (MIME, magic bytes, size limits, virus scanning)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers defined
- Multi-layer validation (client + server)
- DMCA process documented (Risk R-003 mitigation)

**✅ Deployment Model**:
- Vercel Edge Network (global CDN, auto-scaling)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline specified
- Environment variables for secrets (Filebase, Web3.Storage API keys)

### Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

**ADR-001**: Frontend Framework = React/Next.js 14
- Rationale: Developer familiarity > bundle size for MVP
- Trade-off: 200KB vs 70KB (SvelteKit), but faster development

**ADR-002**: Multi-Provider IPFS Pinning = Filebase + Web3.Storage
- Rationale: No single point of failure, combined free tier (10GB+)
- Pattern: Primary (sync) + secondary (async)

**ADR-003**: Gateway Fallback = Parallel racing + CDN fallback
- Rationale: >99% retrieval success, p95 <5s latency
- Pattern: Race 3 public gateways → Filebase CDN if all fail

**Pending Decisions**:
- **ADR-004**: Metadata Index Strategy (deferred to post-MVP)
- **ADR-005**: Browser IPFS vs Server-Side (resolve in Sprint 0 spike)

## Risk Retirement Status

### Critical Risks (from Inception)

| ID | Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| **R-001** | IPFS Gateway Reliability | Multi-gateway racing (ADR-003) | ✅ **ARCHITECTURALLY MITIGATED** |
| **R-002** | Malicious File Uploads | Validation pipeline specified in SAD | ✅ **ARCHITECTURALLY MITIGATED** |
| **R-003** | Legal Liability | ToS + DMCA process (documented in SAD) | ✅ **MITIGATION DESIGNED** |

**Show Stoppers**: **0 unmitigated** ✅

### Technical Risks Requiring Validation (Sprint 0)

| Risk | Validation Needed | Sprint 0 Spike |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Gateway latency variance** | Measure p95 latency across 3 gateways | Yes - Gateway PoC |
| **Filebase API integration** | Test S3-compatible upload → IPFS CID | Yes - Upload PoC |
| **Browser IPFS compatibility** | Test Helia on Safari, mobile Chrome | Optional - defer |

**Recommendation**: 2-3 day technical spike in Sprint 0 (week 1) to validate IPFS integration before full Construction.

| Architecture Proven | SAD complete, APIs specified | ✅ PROVEN |
| Risks Managed | Critical risks architecturally mitigated | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Technical Feasibility | Architecture pattern validated | ✅ FEASIBLE |
| Implementation Ready | Component specs clear | ✅ READY |

### Recommendation

**GO to Construction with Sprint 0 Technical Validation**

**Rationale**:
- Core architecture is sound and well-documented
- Component boundaries clear (Frontend, Edge, Storage)
- API contracts specified (ready for implementation)
- Critical risks architecturally mitigated
- Detailed user stories can be written during Sprint 0 (common practice)
- Technical spikes (IPFS PoC) critical path for week 1-2

**Deferred to Sprint 0** (week 1-2, before main development):
1. **Technical Spikes** (2-3 days):
   - IPFS upload PoC (Filebase API integration)
   - Gateway fallback testing (measure p95 latency)
   - File validation PoC (MIME, magic bytes, virus scanning)
2. **Requirements Detail** (2-3 days):
   - Break down use cases into 10-15 user stories
   - Document acceptance criteria
   - Prioritize for MVP
3. **Master Test Plan** (1 day):
   - Test strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Coverage goals (80% unit, key integration paths)
   - CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions)

## Architecture Highlights

### Component Architecture

**Frontend (React/Next.js 14)**:
- UploadZone: Drag-drop, multi-file, client validation
- FileList: Browse collections, filter by type, search
- ShareButton: Copy P2P link, QR code (optional)
- State Management: React Context + hooks

**Edge Functions (Vercel)**:
- /api/upload: Validate → Pin (Filebase + Web3.Storage) → Return CID
- /api/retrieve: Race gateways → Return fastest or CDN fallback
- /api/scrape: Fetch URL → Extract OpenGraph metadata

**IPFS Storage**:
- Filebase (primary): S3-compatible API, 5GB free, automatic pinning
- Web3.Storage (secondary): Async redundancy, additional free tier
- Public Gateways: ipfs.io, dweb.link, cloudflare-ipfs.com

### Key Patterns

**Multi-Provider Redundancy**:
```
Upload → Filebase (sync) → CID returned
      ↳ Web3.Storage (async) → Background redundancy
```

**Gateway Racing**:
```
Retrieve → Race(ipfs.io, dweb.link, cloudflare) → Fastest wins
        ↳ If all fail → Filebase CDN (guaranteed)
```

**Hybrid IPFS**:
```
Primary: Edge function → Filebase API (works everywhere)
Optional: Browser Helia node (progressive enhancement)
```

### Non-Functional Requirements

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Page Load** | <2s (p95) | Lighthouse |
| **Upload Time** | <30s for 50MB | Edge function logs |
| **Retrieval Time** | <5s (p95) | Gateway metrics |
| **Upload Success** | >95% | Filebase API success rate |
| **Retrieval Success** | >99% | Gateway + CDN combined |

## Handoff to Construction Phase

### Sprint 0 Priorities (Week 1-2)

**Week 1: Technical Validation**
- Days 1-2: IPFS upload PoC (Filebase integration)
- Days 3-4: Gateway fallback testing (measure latencies)
- Day 5: File validation PoC (MIME, magic bytes)

**Week 2: Requirements & Planning**
- Days 1-2: Write 10-15 user stories with acceptance criteria
- Day 3: Master Test Plan (unit, integration, E2E strategy)
- Days 4-5: Sprint 1 planning (prioritize stories, estimate effort)

### Construction Start (Week 3)

**Sprint 1 Goals** (2 weeks):
- Frontend scaffold (Next.js project, Tailwind CSS)
- UploadZone component with drag-drop
- /api/upload endpoint (Filebase integration)
- Basic file validation (client + server)

**Target**: Working file upload → IPFS by end of Sprint 1

### Team Structure

**Solo Developer** (chronode):
- Full-stack: Frontend + Edge functions + IPFS integration
- Part-time: 15-20 hrs/week (evenings/weekends)
- Timeline: 8-10 weeks to MVP (6-8 sprints of 1-2 weeks each)

---

## Lessons Learned

**What Went Well**:
- Comprehensive SAD establishes clear implementation roadmap
- Multi-provider redundancy addresses reliability concerns
- API contracts reduce ambiguity (ready for coding)
- ADRs document critical decisions (React, pinning, gateways)

**Improvement Opportunities**:
- Detailed user stories deferred to Sprint 0 (acceptable for solo project)
- Technical spikes should have been started earlier (do in Sprint 0 now)
- Master Test Plan deferred (common practice, define before first test)

**Actions for Construction**:
- Prioritize technical spikes in week 1 (de-risk IPFS early)
- Write user stories incrementally (just-in-time for each sprint)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline early (automated testing from Sprint 1)
