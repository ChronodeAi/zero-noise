# Phase 4: Middleware Protection & Session Management

**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 (NextAuth setup)  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

## Context & Problem

With authentication implemented, we need to:
1. Protect routes that require authentication
2. Display user session information throughout the app
3. Provide a consistent user navigation experience
4. Enable sign-out functionality

Currently, authenticated users can access the homepage, but there's no visual indication of their session state, and routes are not protected.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-4.1: Route Protection**
- All routes except `/auth/*` require authentication
- Unauthenticated users redirect to `/auth/signin`
- Preserve intended destination in callback URL

**FR-4.2: Session Management**
- Display current user's email in navigation
- Show user's XP score in navigation
- Provide sign-out button
- Session persists across page refreshes

**FR-4.3: Navigation UI**
- Header visible on all authenticated pages
- User menu shows:
  - Email address
  - XP score
  - "Sign out" button
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-4.1: Performance**
- Session check adds <50ms to page load
- Middleware evaluation is efficient

**NFR-4.2: Security**
- Session tokens stored securely (httpOnly cookies)
- Protected routes cannot be bypassed
- Sign-out clears all session data

**NFR-4.3: UX**
- Loading states during session checks
- Smooth redirects (no flash of unauthenticated content)
- Clear feedback when signing out

## Technical Design

### Middleware Implementation

```typescript
// src/middleware.ts
export { auth as middleware } from "@/auth"

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|auth).*)"],
}
```

### Session Provider

Wrap app with `SessionProvider` in root layout to enable `useSession()` hook.

### Navigation Component

Create `src/components/navigation.tsx` with:
- User email display
- XP badge
- Sign-out button
- Responsive hamburger menu for mobile

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unauthenticated users cannot access homepage
- [ ] Sign-in redirects back to intended page
- [ ] User email displays in navigation after sign-in
- [ ] XP score visible in navigation
- [ ] Sign-out button works and redirects to sign-in
- [ ] No flash of protected content before redirect
- [ ] Navigation responsive on mobile

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. Sign out and attempt to access homepage â†’ should redirect
2. Sign in and verify session persists after refresh
3. Check navigation shows correct user info
4. Test sign-out clears session
5. Verify mobile responsive layout

### Edge Cases
- Expired session handling
- Multiple tabs/windows
- Sign-out from one tab affects others
- Network errors during session check

## Open Questions

- Should admins see a special badge/indicator?
- Add profile page link to navigation?
- Show level/title (e.g., "Researcher") in addition to XP?
