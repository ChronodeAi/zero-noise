---

## Acceptance Criteria (Feature-Level)

### Feature Complete When:
- [ ] Admin can whitelist emails via admin panel
- [ ] Admin can generate invite codes with expiry
- [ ] Users can redeem invite codes to get whitelisted

- [ ] Level system functional with 5 levels
- [ ] Search has "My uploads only" toggle
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

---

## Out of Scope (Deferred)

### Not Included in This Feature:

- User profiles or bio pages
- Social features (following, notifications)
- Leaderboards or competitive XP ranking
- Advanced XP mechanics (streaks, bonuses, achievements)
- Email verification (trust whitelist/invite code model)
- Two-factor authentication (low risk for MVP)

---

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies:
- NextAuth.js v5 (beta) for authentication
- Prisma for database schema
- PostgreSQL for user data storage
- bcryptjs for password hashing

### External Dependencies:
- Google OAuth credentials (client ID + secret)
- Email provider (for password reset, deferred to P1)

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| OAuth provider downtime | High | Low | Allow credentials fallback |
| Invite code abuse (mass generation) | Medium | Medium | Admin-only access, rate limiting |
| XP inflation (users spam uploads) | Low | Medium | Implement daily XP cap (deferred) |
| Session hijacking | High | Low | HTTPS only, secure cookies, short expiry |
| Whitelist bypass | High | Low | Server-side enforcement, thorough testing |

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- XP calculation logic (`xp.ts`)
- Invite code generation uniqueness
- Level calculation edge cases

### Integration Tests:
- OAuth flow end-to-end
- Credentials sign-in flow
- Invite code redemption workflow
- XP award on upload

### E2E Tests:
- Admin whitelists email ‚Üí User signs in ‚Üí Uploads file ‚Üí XP awarded
- Admin generates invite ‚Üí User redeems ‚Üí Signs in ‚Üí Uploads file
- Non-whitelisted user blocked from upload API

### Security Tests:
- Attempt admin panel access without auth
- Attempt upload without auth
- Attempt to reuse claimed invite code
- SQL injection on whitelist input
