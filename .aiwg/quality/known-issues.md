# Known Issues and Technical Debt

**Project**: Zero Noise
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Construction Phase - Iteration 3

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. Build Error - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Status**: FIXED (2025-10-23)
**Issue**: TypeScript compilation error in src/app/page.tsx:187 - undefined variable `urlMetadata`
**Impact**: Build failures, deployment blocked
**Resolution**: Changed `urlMetadata.length` to `data.urls?.length || 0`

---

## Security Issues

### 1. Nodemailer Security Vulnerability - ACCEPTED RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: DEFERRED (blocked by dependency constraint)
**Severity**: Moderate (GHSA-mm7p-fcc7-pg87)
**Issue**: Nodemailer <7.0.7 - Email to unintended domain due to Interpretation Conflict
**Root Cause**: next-auth@5.0.0-beta.29 requires nodemailer@^6.6.5 (peer dependency)
**Current Version**: nodemailer@6.10.1
**Fixed Version**: nodemailer@7.0.10+

**Impact Assessment**:
- CVE Severity: Moderate
- Exploit Scenario: Email provider configuration error could send emails to unintended domains
- Zero Noise Usage: Email provider only used for magic link authentication
- Mitigation:
  - Email provider configuration validated in `.env.example`
  - No user-controlled email routing
  - Single trusted email provider (configured by admin)

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Monitor next-auth releases for nodemailer@7.x support
2. Update next-auth when stable version supports nodemailer@7.x
3. Alternative: Switch to next-auth@4.24.11 (stable) if vulnerability becomes critical
4. Target Resolution: Post-MVP (when next-auth v5 stable is released)

**Decision**: ACCEPT RISK for MVP
**Decision Date**: 2025-10-23
**Decision Owner**: chronode
**Review Date**: 2025-11-15 (or when next-auth v5 stable releases)

## Testing Issues

### 1. Test Coverage - RESOLVED ‚úÖ ‚Üí MONITORING üìä
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-10-23)
**Previous Issue**: No test files, no test infrastructure
**Current Status**: 31 tests passing (UploadZone: 8 tests, SSRF Protection: 23 tests)
**Target Coverage**: 30% (Iteration 3), 80% (MVP)

**Completed Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Installed Vitest + React Testing Library + Coverage tools
2. ‚úÖ Configured vitest.config.ts and vitest.setup.ts
3. ‚úÖ Wrote 8 comprehensive tests for UploadZone component (ALL PASSING)
4. ‚úÖ Fixed 2 failing SSRF protection tests (ALL 23 PASSING)
5. ‚úÖ Set up GitHub Actions CI workflow with automated testing
6. ‚úÖ Added test coverage reporting (npm run test:coverage)

**Test Results** (2025-10-23):
```
Test Files: 2 passed
Tests: 31 passed (100% pass rate)
Coverage: Available via npm run test:coverage
```

**Next Steps**:
- Continue writing tests for API routes (upload, auth)
- Target 30% coverage by end of Iteration 3
- Target 80% coverage by MVP

**Timeline**: COMPLETE (completed in 1 day)
**Owner**: chronode

## Dependency Management

### Major Version Updates - DEFERRED üì¶
**Status**: DEFERRED to Post-MVP
**Decision**: Defer major breaking updates until after MVP launch (2025-12-20)

**Packages to Update Post-MVP**:
1. **Next.js**: 15.5.6 ‚Üí 16.0.0 (breaking changes)
2. **React**: 18.3.1 ‚Üí 19.2.0 (breaking changes)
3. **React-DOM**: 18.3.1 ‚Üí 19.2.0 (breaking changes)
4. **Tailwind CSS**: 3.4.18 ‚Üí 4.1.16 (breaking changes)
5. **ESLint**: 8.57.1 ‚Üí 9.38.0 (breaking changes)

**Rationale**: Focus on MVP feature completion, minimize risk of breaking changes

**Post-MVP Update Sprint** (planned for Jan 2026):
- Research migration guides
- Create feature branch for updates
- Test all critical paths
- Update in stages (React first, then Next.js, then Tailwind)

## Infrastructure Gaps

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Status**: CONFIGURED (2025-10-23)
**Previous Issue**: GitHub Actions CI workflow not validated
**Target**: End of Iteration 3 (ACHIEVED EARLY)

**Completed Setup**:
- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - runs tests on PR and push
- [x] TypeScript type checking (npx tsc --noEmit)
- [x] ESLint checks (npm run lint)
- [x] Automated test execution (npm run test:run)
- [x] Test coverage reporting (npm run test:coverage)
- [x] Build validation with environment variables
- [x] Vercel preview deployments (already configured)

**CI Workflow Triggers**:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main/develop branches

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor CI pipeline on next PR
- Consider adding coverage thresholds (30% minimum)

### 2. Code Quality Tooling - PLANNED üîß
**Status**: ESLint configured, no enforcement
**Target**: End of Iteration 4

**Planned Tools**:
- [ ] Prettier (code formatting)
- [ ] Husky (pre-commit hooks)
- [ ] lint-staged (staged file linting)
- [ ] Commitlint (conventional commits)

## Performance Issues

### None Identified üü¢
No performance issues identified at current scale.
**Monitor**: File upload latency, gateway retrieval times as user base grows.

---

## Architectural Technical Debt

### 1. No Database Backups - PLANNED üíæ
**Status**: PLANNED for Transition Phase
**Issue**: SQLite database has no automated backup strategy
**Risk**: Data loss if database file corrupts
**Timeline**: Set up before production launch

**Mitigation Plan**:
- Daily automated backups to cloud storage
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Backup restoration testing
